How to create a month/year picker with jQuery-ui Datepicker
Sometimes you need a date chooser that displays just a month and year instead of a specific day. 

The Datepicker documentation is not very clear on how to do this, so in this project I'm sharing the technique that works for me. 

Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
